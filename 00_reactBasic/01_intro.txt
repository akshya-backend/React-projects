// 1. What is React?

// React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs).
// It focuses on the view layer of an application (in MVC architecture).

// It was created by Facebook (Meta) in 2013, and is now open-source.


// | Feature                      | Meaning                                                               |
// | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
// | **Component-Based**          | UI is built from reusable, independent components.                    |
// | **Declarative**              | You describe *what* UI should look like, React takes care of *how*.   |
// | **Virtual DOM**              | React keeps a lightweight copy of the DOM in memory for fast updates. |
// | **Unidirectional Data Flow** | Data flows in one direction (parent → child).                         |
// | **JSX Syntax**               | Allows writing HTML-like syntax in JavaScript.                        |



How react internally work 

You Write JSX Code
       │
       ▼
Babel Compiler
   (Converts JSX into React.createElement calls)
       │
       ▼
React.createElement()
   (Creates a plain JS object: the React Element)
       │
       ▼
Virtual DOM Tree
   (In-memory representation of the UI)
       │
       ▼
React Reconciliation
   (Compares new Virtual DOM with previous Virtual DOM — "diffing")
       │
       ▼
DOM Update Instructions
   (Only the changed nodes are updated)
       │
       ▼
Browser DOM
   (UI updates instantly without full reload)
